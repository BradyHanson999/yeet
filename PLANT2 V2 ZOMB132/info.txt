
About the Game

An all-new action-strategy game from PopCap, makers of Bejeweled and Peggle!

Zombies are invading your home, and the only defense is your arsenal of plants! Armed with an alien nursery-worth of zombie-zapping plants like peashooters and cherry bombs, you'll need to think fast and plant faster to stop dozens of types of zombies dead in their tracks. Obstacles like a setting sun, creeping fog and a swimming pool add to the challenge, and with five game modes to dig into, the fun never dies!

    * Play five game modes: Adventure, Mini-Games, Puzzle, Survival, plus the stress-free Zen Garden
    * Conquer all 50 levels of Adventure mode — through day, night, and fog, in a swimming pool and on the rooftop
    * Battle 26 types of zombies including pole-vaulters, snorkelers and “Zomboni” drivers
    * Earn 49 powerful perennials and collect coins to buy a pet snail, power-ups and more!
    * Open the Almanac to see all the plants and zombies, plus amusing “facts” and quotes
    * Browse Crazy Dave’s shop for special plants and tools to stem any zombie assault
    * Amazing graphics and soundtrack, plus a bonus music video
    * Infinite replayability: the game is never the same experience twice!
    * Unlock all the Steam Achievements
